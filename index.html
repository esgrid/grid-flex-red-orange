                    <h2>One</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is my first article. What do you think about this? Might it grow or not? It actually depends. On what? Well, that's the question, isn't it? It depends...

                    <h2>Two</h2>
                </div>
                <p>What do you think of this little article? Does it appeal? Or is it, as well, the case that, it depends? It depends...</p>

                <div class="article-title">
                    <h2>Three</h2>
                </div>
                <p>I like this one, to be fair. Don't know how it appears on the screen without saving though?</p>

            <article class="four">
                <div class="article-title">
                    <h2>Four</h2>                
                </div>
                <p>This is also an article, probably in the middle. What does the middle look like?</p>

                <div class="article-title">
                    <h2>Five</h2>
                </div>
                <p>I also like this one, it looks very cool, spanning from row 3 to 4.</p>

            <article class="six">
                <div class="article-title">
                    <h2>Six</h2>
                </div>
                <p>This article is actually very good as well. There is a problem however. The positioning is a bit off. If you see this whole article you'll know one thing: that the designer or developer have fixed it! They've put it in an appropriate position so you can read the whole thing without any issues.</p>

                <p>A nice and mysterious seventh article. Things seem to be progressing...</p>
